### Project 2 Overview of Kultra Mega Stores Inventory Analysis [SEE SQL PROJECT](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KmNoXKgkNiFEEuag1adMWJ7J4ACW6FC0/view?usp=sharing)

As a Business Intelligence Analyst working with the Abuja Division of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), I was responsible for analyzing order data between 2009â€“2012. KMS specializes in office supplies and furniture, catering to individuals, small retail(ers, and corporate clients across Nigeria.
Using SQL, I was tasked with uncovering patterns in:
- Customer behavior
- Product performance
- Regional profitability
- Operational cost efficiency
This analysis was part of the DSA Data Analysis program, focusing on real-world business use cases.

### Tools Used
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- For querying and in-depth analysis of structured data
- Commonly used SQL operations:
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, JOIN, subqueries
- Aggregation: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
- SQL Server for querying and Analysis

### Data Preparation & Cleaning
Properly structured data ensures accurate analysis. Steps include:
1. Handling Missing Data
2. Data loading and inspection
3. Removing Duplicates 
4. Data cldaning and  Formats 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps us understand the dataset before performing deeper analysis. Key steps include:
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which is product are top sellers
- What are the products on the peak sales?

### Key Questions Solved
- Which product category generated the highest revenue?
- What regions lead or lag in sales?
- Who are the most valuable customers by segment?
- Are shipping costs aligned with order priority levels?
- How can underperforming customers be re-engaged?

 ### Insights Delivered
- Strategic recommendations for low-performing customers
- Optimization opportunities in shipping modes and order urgency
- Target product categories for profitability uplift

### Data Analysis & Code Used
Retrieve total sales per month
***  
      SQL
      -- Example: Highest Selling Product Category
     SELECT TOP 1 [Product_Category],
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
     GROUP BY [Product_Category]
     ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
***

### Conclusion
- Excel was powerful for visualizing trends in product reviews and customer feedback on Amazon.
- SQL helped answer important business questions for KMS based on real sales data.
- I used cleaning, exploration, and querying skills to turn raw data into useful insights.
- The findings can help improve marketing, reduce costs, and grow sales.
