As a Business Intelligence Analyst working with the Abuja Division of Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), I was responsible for analyzing order data between 2009â€“2012. KMS specializes in office supplies and furniture, catering to individuals, small retail(ers, and corporate clients across Nigeria.
Using SQL, I was tasked with uncovering patterns in:
- Customer behavior
- Product performance

- Operational cost efficiency
This analysis was part of the DSA Data Analysis program, focusing on real-world business use cases.

### Tools Used
- SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)
- For querying and in-depth analysis of structured data
- Commonly used SQL operations:
- GROUP BY, ORDER BY, WHERE, JOIN, subqueries
- Aggregation: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()
- SQL Server for querying and Analysis

### Data Preparation & Cleaning
Properly structured data ensures accurate analysis. Steps include:
1. Handling Missing Data
2. Data loading and inspection
3. Removing Duplicates 
4. Data cldaning and  Formats 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA helps us understand the dataset before performing deeper analysis. Key steps include:
- What is the overall sales trend
- Which is product are top sellers
- What are the products on the peak sales?

### Key Questions Solved
- Which product category generated the highest revenue?
- What regions lead or lag in sales?
- Who are the most valuable customers by segment?
- Are shipping costs aligned with order priority levels?
- How can underperforming customers be re-engaged?

 ### Insights Delivered
- Strategic recommendations for low-performing customers
- Optimization opportunities in shipping modes and order urgency
- Target product categories for profitability uplift

### Data Analysis & Code Used
Retrieve total sales per month
***  
      SQL
      -- Example: Highest Selling Product Category
     SELECT TOP 1 [Product_Category],
    SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales FROM [dbo].[KMS Sql Case Study]
     GROUP BY [Product_Category]
     ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
